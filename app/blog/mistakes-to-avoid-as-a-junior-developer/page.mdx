# Mistakes to Avoid as a Junior Developer

Starting out development is an exciting adventure, but one fraught with pitfalls. Every junior developer makes mistakes—and that's normal. The important thing is to learn how to spot them and correct them quickly. Here's an overview of the most common mistakes and tips for overcoming them.

---

## 1. Wanting to Learn Everything at Once

Development is an ocean of knowledge. Trying to master everything too quickly can lead to frustration.

**Tip:** Focus on the basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Then, gradually explore frameworks and tools. The key is regular practice and patience.

---

## 2. Underestimating the Importance of Reading the Documentation

Many junior developers turn to tutorials or videos without ever consulting the official documentation.

**Tip:** Take the time to read the documentation. They contain valuable information, often updated before other sources.

---

## 3. Ignoring version control

Not using Git is a common mistake. You risk losing hours of work if you mishandle it.

**Tip:** Learn the basics of Git: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`. Use GitHub to centralize your projects and track your progress.

---

## 4. Being afraid to ask questions

Many juniors hesitate to ask for help, thinking it will make them look incompetent.

**Tip:** Ask questions! The tech community is generally very supportive. Platforms like Stack Overflow, Discord, or Reddit are there to help you.

---

## 5. Not testing your code regularly

Waiting until the end to test an entire project is a recipe for chaos.

**Tip:** Test your code in small steps. Use `console.log()` to debug and familiarize yourself with browser development tools.

---

## 6. Copying without understanding

Copying and pasting code without trying to understand it won't help you progress.

**Tip:** Take the time to analyze each line of copied code. Ask yourself: "What does this line do? Why is it necessary?"

---

## 7. Giving up too quickly

Faced with a bug or difficulty, some people quickly give up, thinking they're not cut out for coding.

**Tip:** Development is about problem-solving. Take breaks, look for solutions, and persevere. Every mistake is a lesson.
